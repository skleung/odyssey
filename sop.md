## Statement of Purpose

My reasons for continuing my studies at Stanford through a coterminal Computer Science degree can be summarized into one overarching mission statement, two main learning objectives, applied towards three main goals.

### Mission Statement
To apply insights from data and design towards high-impact problems in fields like education and healthcare.

### Learning Objectives
1. **Data Science:** To learn how to process and make meaning of large datasets.
2. **Interface Design:** To learn how to design and build effective and user-friendly mobile and web interfaces.

##### Data Science
From oncogenomic trials to deeply connected social graphs, our world today is being rapidly transformed by data-driven insights. My work with the Visual Genome Project under the direction of Dr. Fei-Fei Li and Dr. Michael Bernstein has shown me the power of data-driven insights. Inspired by our current goal of curating a knowledge base for visual learning, I want to learn how to better undersatnd the data around us by learning from:

* CS 124 - To understand how deeper understanding and interesting data points can be drawn from text
* CS 246 - To scale more effective approaches to large datasets
* CS 229 - To recognize patterns and build insights from data itself
* CS 262 - To apply computational approaches to genomic data

##### Interface Design
In a modern world where interfaces race to catch up to dizzying increases of use cases, design has become paramount in the worlds of web and mobile. Industry and personal experiences have given me direct lessons in building web interfaces - learning by doing. 

From CS147, I learned what it means to design intuitive interfaces with the user in mind. In CS142, I learned how to implement those interfaces and design fuller and more substantive applications. In CS 210A, I've learned tremendously from the hands-on experience of learning from and designing for the end user.

I hope to continue an education in design through the courses:

* CS 247 - To apply human-centered design to build interactive interfaces.
* BIOE 273 - To prototype and design mobile-focused applications towards Mobile Health.
* CS 193P - To learn how to effectively program iOS applications for the mobile user.
* CS 376 - To apply teachings towards substantive projects.

### Goals
1. **Continue Teaching**: I wholeheartedly subscribe to the concept of a growth mindset and fostering it as a student and a teacher. My experiences in the CS198 Program, a CS42 Course Assistant, and a CS1C Course Instructor, has allowed me to explore topics and concepts that I found so interesting as a student and even more fulfilling as a teacher. As a coterminal student, I hope to continue exploring and growing my curiosity as a teacher. 
2. **Understanding healthtech**: I strongly believe that healthcare needs more attention and that resources, talent, and interest is being diverted from a field where the barrier for entry is high and prove too challenging for many. As a founder of an initiative called [health++](http://healthpluspl.us), I want to continue exploring healthcare as a student and hope that the classes and experience that I have at Stanford can continue to propel my understanding to eventually make my own impact on the field.
3. **Building to build**: I'm wholely concentrated on building out projects and initiatives for others to build upon. My passion for open source projects have led me to individually contribute to projects like:
  * A knowledge map for learning chemistry
    * A 36-hour hackathon to the nation's top 650 hackers
    * Open source excercise
